                        <span>A little bit about me & why I created this site……<br></span>
                        Growing up, school was always a safe place for me. Some of my fondest childhood memories were shaped by loving  and  kind  teachers  that  fostered  me  to  become  a strong, independent, and confident student of life. Many, many years later when I became a parent and my own children  entered  school,  I  expected  them  to  have  a similar experience. Even though my children were blessed to have a much different home life than I had, I still believed their teachers would continue enhancing their love     of education and life and would offer them varying perspectives, insights, and   motivations to be their best selves.<br>
                        It never dawned on me that their experiences could or would be anything but positive and supportive. Unfortunately, this was not always the case.<br>
                        My boys are now in their teenage years and we have been through pre-school, elementary school, middle school, and now high school. Throughout the years, my children have had amazing, life-enhancing experiences with teachers that epitomize what it means to be a teacher: supportive, kind, encouraging, inspirational, and innovative. Unfortunately, they have also had a few experiences with teachers that were none of those things.<br>
                        As a family, we do not dwell on negative experiences, but instead seek to learn from them, grow, and move on. Every negative teaching experience we have had, lead to an even better one once the dust settled. However, about a year ago, there was an incident involving the type of teacher that may be in the wrong profession or wrong age-group that sparked a thought in me.<br>
                        After being told by one of my son’s teachers that she didn’t have to answer to “some parent” during a meeting with her, my son, the principal, and several other staff members, something in my mind clicked (after I recovered from being stunned by her aggressive and outlandish response to simply being questioned about her negative teaching methods that were impacting my son).<br>
                        When and where do parents and students go at the middle and end of the school year to offer their insights, feedback, and evaluation of their teaching experiences?
                        Students are graded on their performances on homework, tests and quizzes, and even on their attitude in the class. Schools themselves are also graded on how they are meeting the education standards in place. There is no place that parents or students can go to offer their feedback, whether it is positive or negative.<br>
                        How do we expect our teachers to grow and offer our children the best environment for shaping them to become their best selves, if they are not willing to listen to how their teaching methods are being perceived by their most important audience?! Great teachers need to be celebrated and the not-so-great teachers need to be willing to try to improve. The job and role of a teacher is just too important to not want and expect our kids to learn from their teachers operating from their best selves.<br>
                        Since my early twenties, I have made it my personal adage never to complain about anything that I am unwilling to try to fix.  Once our children reach elementary school, our teachers are the people spending the most time with them. The experiences in the classrooms begin to shape and affect our children in ways that often stay with them for the rest of their lives, both the positive and the negative experiences.  The important and fundamental role that a teacher has should allow for feedback from those that it directly affects.<br>
                        My goal with this website is to offer a positive bridge of communication and feedback   that is currently missing between parents, students, and teachers. I want to celebrate those A+  teachers  that  are  making  a  positive  impact  on  our  children,  and  perhaps open the door to assist those teachers not scoring as well to improve their style, technique, or sometimes attitude and turn their classroom into a place that students cannot wait to be a part of.
                        <br>
                        At the end of every school year, once the teacher grades are in, we will pick five A+ teachers to receive supplies to start their next school year off right! And that’s just the beginning…we also want to celebrate students and parents by creating a scholarship program to bridge the gap in this ever increasing, yet underfunding of student grants and loans so those families unable to pay the increasing tuition costs are still able to send their child to college.
